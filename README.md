Hello there! I'm Alessandro, aka Alesanco, a software architect interested in security code reviews and reverse engineering üêõüîç

I love optimizing code through extreme refactoring and trying to improve overall performance üíú
I am always available to help anyone and teach them everything I know.
I have also been a mentor for the [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/), helping children develop logic and learn technology, and I'm in the [Secjuice](https://www.secjuice.com/) Hall Of Fame as Legendary Volunteer.

In my spare time I write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alessandroinnocenzi)
